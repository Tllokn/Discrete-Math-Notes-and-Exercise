# Discrete-Math-Notes-and-Exercise
This is the note for discrete math and some exercise related to specific topic.

These are the class notes from my professor Gerry Brady who I highly appreciated. Just want to record and share the beautiful examples provided by Professor Gerry in class.

### pay attention: This note contains nothing with the homework. Do not try to find the answer from these notes.
